# Creating a Customized UFO Webpage
Module 11 Challenge

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to build an interactive webpage that displays UFO data sightings.  The webpage presents a dynamic table where UFO enthusiasts are able to look up UFO sightings by date, city, state, country and shape.  

### Software & Resources
A code editor, Visual Studio Code, was used to support the following script languages:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Results: How to use the UFO webpage
##### Below is the completed UFO website

To utilize this website, UFO enthusiasts can type in their desired search criteria into the specific search fields.  Once the desired criteria is entered, a table to the right of the search box automatically displays the requested information.  

##### Multiple Search Criteria

## Summary
While the webpage displays a simple, clean, and minimalist design equipped with a serach box that allows users to discover various UFO sightings, the dynamic table may not be readily apparent to users and may cause confusion.  Users may be more accustomed to websites that inform them that the updated information is being displayed, such as a message that states, "Showing results."

### Additional Recommendations for Improvement
- Add a "Filter Search" button: To mitigate confusion of when the dynamic table is updated, it may be helpful to add a button and showcase a message that states "Updated Results"
- Utilize live/current data: an improvement that could help this site is to also allow webscraping which could provide the most up-to-date UFO sightings.
